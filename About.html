        <section class="midParagraph">
            <p class="midParagraphP">I am 16 years old and an avid thinker. I attend school at Buchanan high school where I am a junior. I love to read books and play video games. My favorite video game is Minecraft as I love to create and innovate. I also love technical games such as factory idle which require problem solving because I love to challenge myself to solve problems.

                <br><br>After school I participate in robotics, I am part of the FRC team 1671 the Buchanan Bird Brains. We create robots to compete in various tasks that change every year. I am the head of programming on our team which means that I am in charge of programming the robot and overseeing the other programmers. Last year we made it to the world championship in Houston Texas.
                
                <br><br>I do not travel often as I am content at home. One of the few times I traveled was to Switzerland and Italy as my aunt was studying abroad there. Another time I traveled was to Houston for the worlds robotics competition last year, and back in 5th grade for the little league robotics world champs. The last place I traveled was to Louisiana to see my grandpa who lived there.
                
                <br><br>I plan to go into programming, specifically I am hoping to go into game design. I'm preparing for this by learning as much as I can about various forms of programming. I plan to go to some technical college, but I have not decided which college yet. Next year I plan to go into game design to learn even more about programming and making video games.
                
                <br><br>I am an avid reader and have read hundreds of books over the past few years totaling thousands of chapters. The reason I read books over other activities is because you can find hundreds of them for free, they don't disturb anyone else, and they ignite imagination in readers. Some of my favorite books are Chrysalis, Demons Virtue, and Cultivation Online.
                
                <br><br>After graduating from high school I plan to go to college at a cheap or free school for 2 years, before moving on to a larger more heavily tech focused college or university. I plan to pursue video game design or a similar programming field.</p>
