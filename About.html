            <p class="midParagraphP">I am 18 years old and an avid thinker. I attend school at Buchanan high school where I am a senior. I love to read books and play video games. My favorite video game is Minecraft as I love to create and innovate. I also love technical games such as factory idle which require problem solving because I love to challenge myself to solve problems.

                <br><br>After school I participate in robotics, I am part of the FRC team 1671 the Buchanan Bird Brains. We create robots to compete in various tasks that change every year. I am the Cheif Technical Officer (CTO) on our team which means that I am in charge overseeing the design construction and programming of the robot. This year we made it to the world championship in Houston Texas.
                
                <br><br>I have attended the world championships for FIRST(For Ispiration and Recogniton of Science and Technology) robotics 3 times, twice while in highschool and once in elementary.
                
                <br><br>After graduating from high school I am attending college at California State University Fresno. I plan to pursue video game design or a similar programming field as a major and hopefully eventual career.
                
                <br><br>I plan to go into programming, specifically I am hoping to go into game design. I'm preparing for this by learning as much as I can about various forms of programming. I have attended the Intro to Game Design course at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology to learn even more about programming and making video games.

                <br><br>I am an avid reader and have read hundreds of books over the past few years totaling thousands of chapters. The reason I read books over other activities is because you can find hundreds of them for free, they don't disturb anyone else, and they ignite imagination in readers. Some of my favorite books are Chrysalis, Demons Virtue, and Mech Touch.
