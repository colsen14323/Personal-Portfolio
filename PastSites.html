This was very difficult for my group as we chose Battle Tech as our base game which is very in depth and complex. We also had issues with the multiplayer client we were using interacting with the network we used. But we persevered and collaborated to learn many things about using WebRTC and making such an intricate system run without hanging up.</p>

                        <p class="midParagraphP">The CSS Zen Garden project was to demonstrate how much you can change about your site with purely CSS. This project uses a base HTML file that is provided by CSSzengarden.com which you can then modify with your own CSS. When doing this project I learned how to efficiently use classes to style my code. Though I encountered issues, as at this point I was not taught about flexbox so issues regarding formatting did arise. Though I persisted through it and managed to make a visually pleasing layout using CSS without flexbox.</p>

                        <p class="midParagraphP">The Web Layout Practice project demonstrates my skills to create a website according to a premade design. This shows that if given a design for a site I can create the actual site to match the design. This project taught how to make sites fit the specifications that were given and to match proportions of the design. It was difficult to preserve the view of the site while also taking into account other screen sizes, in order to solve this issue I had to investigate ways of maintaining the proportions of the page as the screen changed.</p>

This site calculates how much money you have to spend after taxes and doing your monthly bills. This site was a great introduction to JavaScript and taught me a lot about how to make a good site with JavaScript. A challenge I had with this site was optimizing the code to be as simple as possible, but after reflecting on the issue I managed to make a simplified version of the code that worked efficiently.</p>
