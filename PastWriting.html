                <em>Career of Choice Essay</em>
                <em>Introduction</em>
                In third grade, I was introduced to programming through “Hour of Code” during computer lab. I was immediately entranced by programming and began pursuing more knowledge. In fourth grade, I joined the FIRST Lego League robotics program, and I have been working my way through the different levels of FIRST robotics as a programmer and am currently a part of a world class team (The Buchanan Bird Brains) as the lead programmer. However, eighth grade was my first experience with writing code for a video game when I took a programming class focused on different types of programming. When I made my first character move around in-game, I knew that game development is what I wanted to do for a living. Game development is a mentally engaging way to make an end product to be proud of, and are enjoyable to use once they are finished, which is why I recommend game development as a career.

                <em>Career Duties </em>
                Video game developers develop video games for computers, consoles, and mobile devices ranging from 2D platformers to 3D shooters. They work on a multitude of things including the gameplay, level design, bug fixing, and making tools to help others develop the game. Some specialized subsets of these programmers are AI(Artificial Intelligence), graphics, network, tool, user interface, and physics programmers (Liming). Video game developers have to meet deadlines for each part of their code, but it is not uncommon for deadline overruns to happen. Each video game developer may work on a section of the game or may collaborate on the whole(Swed). Those that find topics such as these interesting should look into a career in game development. While the work is complicated, the working environment of a video game developer is quite casual.

                <em>Work Environment</em>
                Video game developers have a highly relaxed work environment that lets people express their personality and skills. They often work online or in an office which is often quite lax on rules, but bigger companies may run a stricter office than smaller ”indie” studios. Video game developers usually work in teams to develop games and fix their bugs (Swed). The work that a video game developer does may be monotonous at times, such as testing the same bit of code over and over again for days (Video Game Designers). Those who would thrive in this kind of work environment should take a look at becoming a video game developer. Working months at a time with a group of people may be taxing and can cause stress so having the skills to continue working smoothly is important.

                <em>Important Qualities</em>
                There are a couple important qualities that are useful when pursuing a career in video game development. Working as a video game developer requires a lot of communication between coworkers as the code one developer makes will likely be connected to a different developer's code, the ability to articulate and convey the meaning of the code is a necessary skill for video game developers (Liming). More skills that video game developers need are creative thinking and problem solving, video game developers use creative thinking to come up with new ideas for mechanics and games, while they need to use problem solving skills to bring these ideas to life and solve any bugs that arise (Swed). Naturally video game developers need analytical and programming skills to actually write the code for the game. People that are well versed in these skills will likely find their place in video game development. In order to gain these skills many people take a variety of courses.

                <em>Education/Experience Requirements</em>
                In order to become a video game developer there are a few criteria that most companies are looking for in a new hire. First of all, most hiring companies prefer if the applicant has at least a bachelor's degree in something game development or computer science related (Swed). Something that matters more though, is experience and skills in the kind of software video game developers are using such as unity and unreal engine, which could be learned from a college class or an online bootcamp (Liming). Completing a bootcamp or taking college classes about video game development is a leap to becoming a video game developer. Depending on the skills learned through these courses, the pay of a video game developer can vary greatly.

                <em>Salaries</em>
                Video game developers can make a wide range of salaries, where the main factor is experience. Entry level video game developers make around $48.6K a year while the average video game developer makes $98K a year (Video game designer salary). As stated before, the main differences that designate the pay grade of video game designers are experience and skills (Game Designer Salary), so those with more of these can earn up to 163.4 thousand dollars per year if they are in the top 20% of video game developers. Video game development has the potential to make a lot of money for those in the field, so for those interested in making lots of money video game development may be an option to look into. With these salaries many people want to get into video game development, lucky job opportunities for video game developers are increasing every year.

                <em>Job Outlook</em>
                Video game development is on the rise and new job openings are looking promising in the future. The amount of video game developers is expected to grow 9.3% between 2016 and 2026 (The job market). According to “Career Outlook for Video Game Designers” there will be an average increase of 2.28% per year with 32,090 new jobs anticipated by 2029. This will create many openings for new aspiring video game developers. With all of these new jobs, more and more people are looking for ways to learn about becoming a video game developer.

                <em>Educational Institution Options</em>
                There are a multitude of options that one can use in order to learn the skills that are needed for video game development, though college is a common choice, the most prominent way to learn about becoming a video game developer is taking an online ”bootcamp” that teaches all of the technical skills that beginning video game developers need. One option to learn skills that are needed to become a video game developer is the “Deep Dive Intro to Game Design & Development” bootcamp, a short 4-week course that teaches industry standard practices for the most commonly used game development software, Unity. This course teaches the necessary skills to start making games with professional software. Another course that aspiring video game developers may take is the “LEARN UNITY IN 8 WEEKS” course by Playcrafting, which is a longer 8-week course that teaches skills, principles, and theory used in video game development. This course not only teaches the skills needed to make the game, but also the theory behind each aspect of the video game and how to make a good one. For those interested in going into the field of video game development, these courses may be a good starting point to learn the skills needed for the job.

                <em>Conclusion</em>
                I love to challenge myself by fixing problems and finding solutions to objectives. Game Development also works towards making a product that is impressive and enjoyable to use. I will be pursuing a career in Game design, as I find it very enjoyable and rewarding to use the final product. Because of this I will be learning more about game development in the future, which is why I am going to be taking the Interactive Game Development class at Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) next year. I hope to get a successful start into video game development and I hope others also take interest in this amazing job.

            <p class="midParagraphP">This was the Career of Choice Essay which was a persuasive essay covering a career that we would like to go into in the future. This essay talked about reasons why others should go into this career. I am sharing this example because this essay shows that I am passionate about game development and dearly wish to pursue a career in it.</p>
            <p class="midParagraphP"><em>Intro</em>
                Delve Homes is a fictitious company based on the idea of subterranean dwelling found in the book The Machine Stops by E. M. Forster. The goal of the assignment was to create a website for this fictitious company to advertise for their underground automated homes.
                <em>Reading</em>
                In The Machine Stops the housing that everyone lives in is buried deep underground and contains a myriad of technologies and equipment to make life easier. The automation has reached such a point that people never need or want to leave their rooms. From automated cooking and medical care to pop out beds and video calls built into the room.
                <em>Competitors</em>
                There are many home developer websites that may be competitors for DelveHomes' website. One such site is Wilson Homes based in Australia, they have a clean block based design that showcases all of their previous projects. Another site is Deauville East, a subdivision site in Clovis, they have a very welcoming atmosphere about their site.
                <em>Wireframe</em>
                In order to plan a website a wireframe is created, The wireframe for the DelveHomes site focused mostly on readability rather than aesthetics. Wireframes are very useful when planning a website as they are used to plan out the layout of each part of the website.
                <em>Development</em>
                The development of the DelveHomes website was split into three phases: content, formatting, and aesthetics. The content of the DelveHomes site was written before we finalized the layout in the wireframe allowing us to adjust the layout for additional content. Once the content has been finalized the layout can be adjusted and programmed. Once the layout has been created then the properties of the layout can be adjusted to create the desired aesthetics.
                <em>Presentation development</em>
                Once the programming was completed we worked on our presentation, we split up our slides evenly and got to work finding an image and appropriate text for each slide.
                <em>Presentation</em>
                We split up our slides evenly to present alternating every slide, this allowed us each break from talking and time to think about what to say next slide. Before we presented we ran through our presentation once to see how long it would take and what parts we needed to practice and find more on.</p>
            <p class="midParagraphP">The Delve Homes Reflective Essay was a reflection on our project on making a website about the housing from The Machine Stops by E. M. Forster. The reason I selected this essay is because it gives insight into the design process that was used to make my sites.</p>
