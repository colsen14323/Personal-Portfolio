                To Whom It May Concern,
                <br>
                It is my privilege to write on behalf of Colby Olsen. Colby is enrolled in Buchanan's CTE
                Engineering pathway and has been an active member of the honors courses for three years.
                Currently, Colby is enrolled in our Engineering Design & Development class, which is a capstone
                course that mimics a senior design project that one might take in college. Students are in a group
                with their peers for the entire year and work together to find a problem, brainstorm a solution, build
                a prototype, and test it. Colby is an excellent group member and works hard to bring ideas to life.
                Colby demonstrates a wide range of expertise in engineering disciplines but mainly focuses
                on coding. During the engineering courses, Colby has incorporated coding into his designs to take
                his projects to an advanced level. When working in groups, he is enthusiastic to contribute his skills
                in various types of computer programming. Another strength I see in the classroom is Colby's
                interest to help problem solve. He is the first person to jump into a project and ask questions to get
                his peers to think critically and arrive at a successful solution.
                In addition to his achievements in the classroom Colby is also involved with the Robotics
                Team, working with team members to build a successful robot. He balances school and outside
                commitments well and stays organized with his work. As a teacher, I am grateful for Colby's
                contributions to the classroom.
                <br>
